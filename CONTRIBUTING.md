Check out the [Developers guide](docs/devwiki.md)

## Tests Units

ATtila is provided with tests units, which can be found under tests/ directory.
To launch test unit just type:

```sh
nosetests -v --with-coverage --cover-tests --cover-package=attila --nocapture tests/
```

Don't you have nose?

```sh
sudo -H pip3 install nose coverage unittest2 codecov
```

## Linting and format

This is the current configuration for linting and format:

for code format, we use `Black`

```sh
pip3 install black
```

with the default configuration.

For linting we use `flake8`

```sh
pip3 install flake8
```

and has to be run with:

```sh
flake8 attila/
```
